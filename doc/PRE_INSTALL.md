Element Call requires a homeserver with registration enabled without any 3pid
or token requirements, if you want it to be used by unregistered users.

Furthermore, it is not recommended to use it with an existing homeserver where
user accounts have joined normal rooms, as it may not be able to handle those
yet and it may behave unreliably.
